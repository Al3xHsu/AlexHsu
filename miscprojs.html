									<h1>Miscellaneous Projects</h1>
								</header>
								<p>To everyone that's made it here, hello! Thank you so much for reading through the rest of my website! I really do appreciate it :) .
								This page is just a little thing I added in at the end of my last post, something more casual where I just show a little anthology of some random
								 projects and things that I think are neat or funny, so I hope you enjoy!
								</p>
								<p>First, I want to show a little rocket I made back in high school. I followed a YouTube video where a guy made a sugar rocket, where
									the motor is made with a mixture of sugar, the fuel, and potassium nitrate, the oxidizer. This was the summer after my senior year
									in high school, so I really only had one shot to get my first hands-on foray into aerospace off the ground (no pun intended). You can
									see the video below!  
								</p>
								<video width = "1190" height = "800" controls><source src="video/rawket.mp4" type = "video/mp4"></video>
								<p>(It didn't work)</p>
								<p>Next, I wanted to show all of you a more successful project: a home made flamethrower >:) . I used an old fire extinguisher I found
									in my garage, drilled in a hole and shoved in a tire valve, filled it with lighter fluid, and used a bicycle pump to pressurize it. 
									To light it, I just hose clamped a bent copper pipe with a wick from one of those tiki torches soaked with lighter fluid stuffed inside
									onto the fire extinguisher. Bada bing, bada boom, FIRE! (it was kinda scary how easy this was to make).
								</p>
								<video width = "1190" height = "690" controls><source src="video/FLAMETHROWERRRRR.mp4" type = "video/mp4"></video>
								<p>This next one is kind of random, but I think it's funny. It's a video I made for my writing class in my first year of college, with the prompt being 
									to explore how technology improves over time, and how sometimes new developments aren't always good. I chose to look at trains, and, well,
									the result is shown below.
								</p>
								<video width = "1190" height = "690" controls><source src="video/EXPOS II Vid.mp4" type = "video/mp4"></video>
								<p>Lastly, I have a few pictures from when I flew a plane! I was part of the Civil Air Patrol, and one of the things you get to do when you 
									first join is fly a plane (this was the main reason I joined so I was practically jumping out of my seat when it happened).
									 We flew a Cessna Skyhawk, and the pilot was the one who did take-off and landing. However, once we got to cruising altitude, he handed over the
									 controls for a few minutes, and this just solidified my desire to eventually get a pilot's license. To this day, if I ever have to tell anyone
									 a "fun fact" about myself for an icebreaker, this is still the thing I always go back to!
