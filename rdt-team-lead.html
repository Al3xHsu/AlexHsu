								<h2>New Year, New Leads</h2>
								<p>This is now my third year at the NYU Robotics Design Team (RDT), and I’m the Team Lead along with one other person. A summary of what RDT does: we participate in the NASA Lunabotics challenge, where NASA invites college teams from across the country to create a rover capable of navigating a simulated Lunar surface and collect and deposit as much regolith into the construction zone in a predetermined time, with an emphasis on autonomy. Teams are given nine months to design, manufacture, and test their robots before selected teams are invited to compete at the Kennedy Space Center. NASA offers broad guidelines, granting teams significant freedom in the physical design of their robots. RDT, in particular, emphasizes developing new and innovative designs each year. Although the school year hasn’t started yet, my co-lead and I have already gotten to work.</p>
								<p>Our main project was reworking the workflow of the team. Last year, we had made a robot that worked successfully (the most successful one in our history in fact), but that doesn’t mean we don’t have room for improvement. One issue was that there was very little communication between competencies (mechanical, electrical, and software) during the initial design of the robot. The best way I can put it is each competency looked at the requirements and interpreted it through their own lens without consulting each other. An example of this was that the design that mechanical came up with (and ended up going through with) was not compatible with software’s autonomous strategy, since it used a rectangular chassis which could not turn in place. The issue was since the two didn’t talk with one another, this was only discovered after the mechanical team had made most of their design, so software had to spend the rest of the year changing their strategy to work with that design.</p>
								<p>Additionally, communication between competencies after the initial design phase was a bit convoluted. Technical leads would tell systems engineers issues during competency meetings, systems engineers would tell the other competency’s systems engineers at the system engineering meetings, who would then have to tell their technical leads at their competency meetings. This meant if there was any discourse between competencies, it could take weeks to actually conclude. Another result of this lack of communication was that the workflow was very linear; mechanical would make a design, hand it off to electrical, who would wire it and send it to software. It wasn’t the most efficient way of going about things, so my co-lead and I created a new system to remedy this.</p>
								<h2>Communication, Communication, Communication</h2>
								<p>Our system would make it so that there are points of contact from each competency assigned to each subsystem (for example, for the excavation subsystem, there is a mechanical lead, an electrical lead, and a software lead who would serve as the go to person for anything related to that subsystem). During the initial design phase, the technical leads serving as the points of contact for that subsystem would come together and create multiple design proposals for that subsystem based on requirements made by the systems engineers, ensuring that each competency gets a say in how the design will look. Following this, there are going to be large review sessions with all technical leads and systems engineers present, where the representatives of each subsystem will present their designs. The other technical leads can then look at those designs from the lens of their specific competency, while the systems engineers can judge them based on requirements and how they would fit into the design as a whole. The final initial design will be chosen based on feasibility for each competency, adherence to requirements, and which would perform the best based on competition metrics. After the initial design phase, the points of contact would serve as direct lines of communication between each competency rather than having to go through the system engineers, and also be responsible for coordinating the testing of their individual subsystems.</p>
								<p>The aim of these changes is to streamline communication and to ensure that each competency has an equal say in the design of the robot. Additionally, because each competency will have a say in how it is designed, they will know what each competency needs from one another. This further streamlines the design process, since competencies will be able to work in tandem and combine their work at the end of the process, rather than before where each competency had to wait for the prior one to finish working before starting. We’ll see how this new system goes once the year starts, and I’ll keep you updated!</p>
								<h2>Setting Up For a New Year</h2>
								<p>Aside from that, my co-lead and I have also created a project timeline outlining all the major milestones and deadlines we would like to meet, as well as a preliminary budget for the team. We’ve also been the main points of contact with both our university and NASA, and we’ve just begun working with the system engineers to create the Concept of Operations, the System Hierarchy, and the initial requirements. I hope that I’m able to do as well as all the team leads before me, and I’m greatly looking forward to (and maybe a tad nervous for) this upcoming year!</p>
								<p>(Here's something extra since this one is still a work in progress:<a href="miscprojs.html"> a small list of random projects and things that I think are neat!)</a></p>
